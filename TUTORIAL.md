## Overview

ZeppOS Nextcloud Tasks is a comprehensive task management application with full Nextcloud/CalDAV synchronization. Manage tasks, create subtasks, set priorities and categories, configure reminders - all synced with your Nextcloud server or stored locally on your device.

**Key Features:**
- Full Nextcloud/CalDAV sync with proxy architecture
- Offline local lists stored on watch
- App-based persistent reminders (no phone needed)
- Native voice dictation for quick task entry
- Priorities, categories, subtasks, due dates
- Compatible with Tasks.org and standard CalDAV clients

---

## Initial Setup

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/1.jpg" width="300" alt="Phone Setup Screen">
</p>

When you first install the app, you'll need to configure Nextcloud synchronization through the Zepp phone app.

### Connecting to Nextcloud:

1. Open **Zepp app** on your phone
2. Go to **App Settings** → **Tasks NC**
3. You'll see the **"Set up sync"** screen
4. Tap **"Use Nextcloud server account"**
5. Enter your connection details (see next section)

**Note:** This step is done in the Zepp phone app, not on the watch. The watch will sync automatically after configuration.

---

### Nextcloud Configuration

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/2.jpg" width="300" alt="Nextcloud Configuration">
</p>

After tapping "Use Nextcloud server account", you'll need to enter your connection details:

#### Server URL
Enter your Nextcloud CalDAV URL:
```
https://your-nextcloud-server.com/remote.php/dav/
```

**Important:** 
- Must be the full CalDAV path ending in `/dav/`
- Example: `https://kai.nl.tab.digital/remote.php/dav/`

The app will validate the URL and show "Nextcloud URL is valid" if correct.

#### Username
Your Nextcloud username (not email address).

#### Password
Your Nextcloud password **OR** app password.

**If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled:**
- You MUST create an app password in Nextcloud
- Go to Nextcloud Settings → Security → Devices & sessions
- Create a new app password
- Use that password here instead of your main password

#### Proxy URL (Advanced Users)
**Default:** `https://caldav-proxy-emn8.vercel.app`

**Most users:** Leave this as the default - it works for everyone.

**Advanced users:** You can self-host your own proxy instance if desired. Instructions available in the [README](https://github.com/ether-strannik/zeppos-tasks-nc-api4#nextcloud-setup) and [CalDAV Proxy Repository](https://github.com/ether-strannik/caldav-proxy).

**Why a proxy?** ZeppOS only supports GET/POST methods, but CalDAV needs PROPFIND/REPORT/PUT/DELETE. The proxy translates these for compatibility.

---

### Login Success

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/3.jpg" width="300" alt="Login Success">
</p>

After entering your credentials correctly, you'll see the **"Login success"** confirmation screen.

**What this means:**
- Your credentials have been validated
- The app can now access your Nextcloud tasks
- Your watch will automatically sync with your Nextcloud server

**Next steps:**
- The configuration is saved in the Zepp app
- Open the Tasks NC app on your watch

**To disconnect:** Tap **"Log out"** if you need to change servers or credentials.

---

## Using the Watch App

### Task Lists Screen

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/5.jpg" width="300" alt="Task Lists Screen">
</p>

After setup, open the Tasks NC app on your watch. You'll see the **Task Lists** screen where you can navigate between your task lists.

**What you'll see:**

#### CalDAV Lists (Synced from Nextcloud)
- Lists synced from your Nextcloud server appear at the top
- Example: **"Today"** - your default Nextcloud task list
- Tap any list to view its tasks

#### Local Lists (Offline)
- **+ Create local list** - Create a new offline task list stored on your watch
- **Manage local lists...** - View, edit, or delete existing local lists
- Local lists work completely offline without internet

#### Settings
- **Settings** - Configure app preferences (sorting, display options, etc.)

**Tip:** You can use both CalDAV and local lists simultaneously. For example, sync work tasks from Nextcloud while keeping personal tasks in a local list.

## Reminders & Alarms

### CalDAV Reminders (Standard)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/20.jpg" width="300" alt="Due Date and Reminder">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/19.jpg" width="300" alt="Reminder Options">
</p>

#### Setting Standard Reminders

When you set a **Due Date** and **Reminder** on a task, it creates a standard CalDAV VALARM:

**Due Date:** 2025-12-30 19:04
- Tap to set when the task is due
- Opens calendar and time picker

**Reminder Options:**

**Remind me in...**
- **+ Pick duration** - Set custom time from now to remind you

**Before due:**
- **When due** - Reminder at exact due date/time
- **5 min before** - Reminder 5 minutes before due
- **10 min before, 15 min before, 30 min before** (scrollable)
- **1h before, 2h before, 1d before** (more options)

**Clear reminder** - Remove the reminder

**How it works:**
- Uses standard VALARM property (Tasks.org compatible)
- Phone app (like Tasks.org) sends notification to Zepp app
- Zepp app displays notification on watch
- **Limitation:** Notification appears once, then disappears
- **Requires:** Phone nearby with Nextcloud sync app running

**App reminder:** 12/30, 19:04
- Shows when the next app-based reminder is scheduled (see below)

---

### App-Based Reminders (Persistent)

**For persistent, watch-native reminders that don't rely on phone notifications:**

The app includes **App-Based Reminders** using ZeppOS Alarm API:

**Key Differences:**
- **CalDAV**: Requires phone connection when reminder fires
- **App-based**: Requires connection when setting up, but fires independently after that
- **Persistent** - Continuous vibration and sound until dismissed
- **Alarm-style** - Like a real alarm, not just a notification
- **Locally saved** - Stored on watch, not CalDAV server
- **Full control** - Snooze, complete task, or dismiss

**How to enable:**
1. Edit task and set due date and standard reminder
2. After due date and standard reminder have been set, set app-based reminder
3. Task edit screen shows **"App: 12/30, 19:04"** - next scheduled alarm
4. When alarm fires, you get full-screen popup with options

**When alarm fires:**
- Full-screen alert popup appears
- Continuous vibration (customizable pattern)
- Sound alerts (optional)
- Options: Complete Task, Snooze, or Dismiss

**Use cases:**
- Important deadlines that can't be missed
- Tasks requiring persistent reminders

**Note:** App-based reminders are independent from CalDAV VALARM. You can use both simultaneously for maximum reliability!

---

### Configuring App-Based Reminders

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/26.jpg" width="300" alt="App-Based Reminder Settings">
</p>

Before the alarm fires, you can configure default behavior in the task edit screen:

**Sound and vibration:**
- **OFF** - Toggle to enable/disable sound and vibration for this task
- Customizable per task

**Snooze:**
- **5 min** - Default snooze duration
- Tap to change (1min, 5min, 10min, 15min, 30min, 1h options)
- This is the initial snooze time when alarm fires

**Schedule reminder:**
- Schedules reminder independent of CalDAV VALARM

---

### When the Reminder Fires

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/27.jpg" width="300" alt="Reminder Popup">
</p>

When your app-based reminder triggers, a full-screen alarm popup appears:

**Task Information:**
- **Title:** "Buy bread."
- **Description:** "Buy bread and butter." (if notes were added)
- Both displayed clearly at the top

**Alert Behavior:**
- Continuous or non-continious vibration
- Sound alerts (if enabled)
- Screen stays on for 10 minutes
- Works even when app is closed

**Three Action Buttons:**

**Complete** (Green)
- Marks task as complete
- Cancels all future alarms for this task
- Syncs completion to Nextcloud (if CalDAV list)
- Closes app

**Snooze** (Yellow/Orange)
- Opens time picker to set snooze duration
- Creates new alarm for specified time
- Task remains incomplete
- Closes app

**Dismiss** (Red)
- Stops vibration and sound immediately
- Task remains incomplete
- No new alarm created
- Closes app

---

### Custom Snooze Duration

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/25.jpg" width="300" alt="Snooze Time Picker">
</p>

When you tap **Snooze**, a time picker appears:

**Time Format:** HH:MM
- Default shows your configured snooze time (00:05 = 5 minutes)
- Tap number keys to set custom duration
- Example: "00:30" = 30 minutes, "01:00" = 1 hour

**Quick Entry:**
- **:00** button - Add 00 to hours
- **:30** button - Add 30 to minutes
- Number keys - Enter specific time

**Tap OK** to set the snooze and create new alarm

**Example workflow:**
1. Reminder fires at 2:00 PM
2. Tap **Snooze**
3. Enter "00:15" (15 minutes)
4. New alarm set for 2:15 PM

## Native Keyboard (API 4.2)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/17.jpg" width="300" alt="T9 Keyboard">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/18.jpg" width="300" alt="Voice Dictation">
</p>

### SYSTEM_KEYBOARD Integration

Starting with ZeppOS API 4.2, Tasks NC uses the native **SYSTEM_KEYBOARD** for all text input. This provides a much better user experience compared to custom keyboards.

T9 Keyboard with voice dictation makes Tasks NC truly practical for quick task capture.

Tap the **microphone icon** to activate voice input:

**Perfect for:**
- Creating tasks quickly: "Buy groceries for dinner"
- Adding detailed notes: "Remember to pick up milk, eggs, and bread from the store on Main Street"
- Setting task descriptions without typing
- Creating multiple tasks rapidly

**Example workflow:**
1. Tap **+** to create task
2. Tap microphone
3. Say: "Call dentist to reschedule appointment"
4. Text appears instantly
5. Tap to save

---

## Local Lists (Offline Mode)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/22.jpg" width="300" alt="Local List">
</p>

### Creating and Using Local Lists

Local lists are task lists stored entirely on your watch, independent of any Nextcloud server or internet connection.

**Creating a Local List:**
1. From Task Lists screen, tap **+ Create local list**
2. Enter a name using the native keyboard
3. The list is created and saved locally

**Local List Features:**

Local lists support **all the same features** as CalDAV lists:
- Task titles and descriptions
- Priority levels (0-9) with colored rings
- Categories/tags
- Subtasks with unlimited nesting
- Due dates with countdown
- Start dates
- GPS location
- Task completion status
- Alphabetical sorting
- **Reminders** - Implementation pending

**Key Differences from CalDAV Lists:**
- **No sync** - Data stays on your watch only
- **No internet needed** - Works completely offline
- **Fast** - No network delays
- **Independent** - Not tied to any server

**Use Cases:**
- Personal tasks you don't want synced
- Privacy-sensitive information
- Quick temporary task lists
- When you don't have a Nextcloud server
- Offline-only workflows

**Combined Workflow:**
You can use local lists and CalDAV lists simultaneously. For example:
- Work tasks → CalDAV list (synced with team)
- Personal tasks → Local list (private, offline)

#### Task Lists Overview

The main **Task Lists** screen shows all your lists organized by type:

**CalDAV Lists:**
- Synced from your Nextcloud server
- Examples: "Task List", "Today"
- Require internet connection

**Local Lists:**
- **+ Create local list** - Create new offline list
- **Manage local lists...** - Delete existing local lists

**Combined View:**
- Both CalDAV and local lists accessible from same screen
- Switch between them seamlessly
- Use both simultaneously for different purposes

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Task Capture
- Use **voice dictation** for fastest task creation
- Speak naturally: "Buy groceries tonight at 6pm"
- Add details immediately while you remember them

### Sync Best Practices
- **Pull down to refresh** when you need latest tasks from Nextcloud
- Enable "Pull down to refresh" in Settings for quick sync gesture

### Reminder Strategy
**For maximum reliability, use both:**
- **CalDAV VALARM** - Phone notifications (requires phone nearby)
- **App-based reminders** - Watch alarms (works offline, persistent)

**When to use each:**
- CalDAV: Routine tasks, when phone is always nearby
- App-based: Critical deadlines, when phone might not be available

### Organization Tips
- Use **priorities** (1-9) to color-code importance at a glance
- Use **categories** to group related tasks (#Work, #Personal, #Urgent)
- Create **subtasks** for multi-step projects
- Use **local lists** for private tasks that shouldn't sync

### Troubleshooting

**Sync not working?**
1. Check credentials in Zepp app settings
2. Use app password if you have 2FA enabled
3. Try "Wipe ALL local data" for fresh start

**Tasks not showing?**
1. Pull down to refresh
2. Check "Show complete tasks" setting
3. Verify you're in correct list
